#     Integration of spaCy: I imported the spaCy library and loaded its English language model (en_core_web_sm).
#     This model is used for tokenization of user inputs.
#
#     Tokenization function: The tokenize_input function was modified to utilize spaCy for tokenization.
#     Now, the function takes the input text, processes it using spaCy, and returns a list of lowercase tokens without punctuation.
#
#     Usage in chatbot: Throughout the chatbot code, the tokenize_input function is used to tokenize user inputs before processing them.
#     This allows for more accurate handling of user commands and responses.

# Example of how spaCy uses tokens
# Feel free to say hello, ask me to guess your age, or just chat with me.
# You: hi
# Tokens: ['hi']
# Hi there!
# You: hello!, how are you doing?
# Tokens: ['hello', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'doing']
# Hi there!
# You:
